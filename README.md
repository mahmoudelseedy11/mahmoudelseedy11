I'm a Mechatronics who is passionate about making contributing to R&D in Automation and Robotics Fields, creating technology to elevate people, and building community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Embedded Linux, Computer Vision and Robotics [Even if it is from POV of SW or HW side]. Hopefully that provide more and more for this technology as i find myself in working on it.
